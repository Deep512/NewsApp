# News App

## Demo
![Simulator Screen Recording - iPhone 15 Pro - 2024-06-14 at 09 29 02](https://github.com/Deep512/NewsApp/assets/42740971/96dded07-f0a4-4ba4-8fa8-9c818b008047)

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deep512/NewsApp.git
cd NewsApp
```

- Install the dependencies and pods
```bash
npm install
cd ios && pod install
```

- Build and run the application in your simulator
```bash
cd ..
npm run ios --reset-cache
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app. You can also run it directly from within Xcode respectively.
